Summary: A look at hazing deaths on record in the United States




I personally don't understand why physically harming pledges is required to instill in them a sense of brotherhood. I feel I'd personally feel too uncomfortable to partake in the hazing, but I also haven't been in an environment where hazing was ever normalized. 


I hope for a college environment where people don't feel pressured to drink themselves to death to fit in.  Since the 


Has hazing become more or less prevalent over time? How have rituals changed over time? Unfortunately, the answers to those questions aren't as simple to find as they might seem. Hazing rituals are most often performed in the process of inducting new members into a group. 



It certainly depends on how hazing is defined, as well as the source of the data. In addition, drawing valuable insights on hazing data simply obtaining data about hazing proves particularly challenging, considering the following: 

- Victims are sworn to secrecy(whether by threat of nonmembership or further physical abuse as retaliation)
- The U.S. population has increased considerably over the time period studied, but proportional comparisons are inappropriate, considering changing media coverage of hazing over time. 
- There exists no official centralized database for hazing data. 
- college enrollment (and presumably fraternity involvement) decreased during wartime 


For the reasons above, comparing the quantity of hazing deaths over time isn't particularly useful. Instead I decided to compare trends in rituals leading to deaths. 



Pledges being sworn to secrecy leads to underreporting. 





If you or someone you know feels physically, emotionally, mentally, or sexually violated as a result of hazing, please reach out. If you have hazed or are currently involved in hazing others, 

You don't have to feel alone and certainly don't have to interact 





No matter how secret hazing rituals are supposed to be, when one ends in death, disturbing details emerge. 


When it comes to hazing experiences, pledges are sworn to secrecy.



This also begs the question: has hazing actually become more of a problem? 



 But I also don't understand why you would want to live in a house with 30 other people. 

I love to read about the activities of communities I'll never be part of. One community that specifically intere I can't recall a time I was invited to a frat party.

I was talking to my dad about the sudden shift, speculating on the possible cause. He reminded me that when he was in college, states were required to increase the legal drinking age to 21. Noncomplying states would be penalized by a 10% cut in highway funding. I decided to look back at the data I'd collected and make note of the share of hazing deaths attributed to alcohol intoxication (including, but not limited to alcohol poisoning, asphyxiation by )

I was particularly disturbed when I read the story of Tim Piazza,
